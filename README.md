# BrainTumorDetectionWithCNN
Brain Tumor Detector is a simple web app made  with the help of streamlit frame work, It allows the user to upload an MRI image based on whether an image consist of Meningioma,Pituitary and the app will be abple to classify 
the state of the tumor and deliver the results right up front.
The model was developed by using the Convolution Neural Network using VGG3 block architecture images sample were taken from kaggle. Images were trained with accuracy of 97%
